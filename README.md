- [Running C# Code with 'csc'](#running-c-code-with-csc)

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you compile and run the files on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (for C#)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for Node.js)

Once installed, update your environment PATH variable to include the paths for Node.js and the latest version of the C# compiler.

- **For Node.js:** If you installed Node.js using the default settings, you can find it typically in C:\Program Files\nodejs\.
- **For C#:** The C# compiler (csc.exe) is commonly located in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\.

### Project Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BiancaCena/CodingChallenge.git
   ```

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file you want to run:

   ```sh
   cd problem_set_x
   ```

### Running Node.js Code with node

Use the node command followed by the name of the JavaScript file to execute it. For example:

```sh
node file_name.js
```

### Running C# Code with 'csc'

The .NET Software Development Kit (SDK) is required to compile and run C# programs. It provides the csc command-line tool (C# Compiler), which is used to compile C# source code into executable files.

**A. Compiling C# Code:**

- To compile the C# program, run the following command in cmd:

  ```sh
  csc file_name.cs
  ```

**B. Running Compiled C# Code:**

- After successful compilation, you can run the compiled executable file using its name. For example:

  ```sh
  file_name
  ```

- Alternatively, you can explicitly specify the .exe extension:

  ```sh
  file_name.exe
  ```

- You can also run the code by clicking the executable file directly.
